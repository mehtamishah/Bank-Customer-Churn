# Project: Improving Bank Customer Retention
Addressing the issue of customer churn in a bank <br>
**Business problem is fictitious and has been designed by me to help you build business acumen*

Business Problem: <br>
The CEO of a bank is focusing on customer retention as a part of the business strategy for the next financial year. He has asked you to present a business case for a project to reduce customer attrition by the end of the week. <br>
This is all the data that the bank has : [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)<br>

Business Metric: <br>
Customer Turnover rate = 
(Customers lost at the end of a given period / Number of customers at the start) * 100 % <br>

Words of Advice: <br>
Think of what you would do before you scroll down. That's how you will build your data science decision making skills. A majority of education tells you what to do instead of teaching you how to make better decisions yourself. The problem with this kind of education is threefold. The obvious one, is that decision making skills are not honed. The next one is the vice of falling in love with your solution, instead of the customer. Something shiny is created, but real value suffers. Finally, the less obvious problem and the silent killer is that it pervades a false sense of righthood. It discounts the inherent uncertainity that is involved in any project even after you do complex mathematical gymnastics. <br>

What tools you use or steps you take only make sense when the context is defined. The context can that be of the business problem, of the market, of the stakeholders, of data availability and much, much more. Only when you define the context does any of the decisions that follow make sense. Since this is a fictitious project, I have shared the assumptions I making about the context in the relevant sections. <br>

So let's get to it! <br><br>

My Process: <br>

Step 1. Analytics <br>
* Slicing 25% of the dataset for analytics. Here's the [code](https://github.com/mehtamishah/Bank-Customer-Churn/blob/main/Dividing_the_dataset.ipynb)
* [Summarizing data for self](https://github.com/mehtamishah/Bank-Customer-Retention/blob/main/Summarizing%20the%20data%20for%20yourself)
* Summarizing data for stakeholders and inspiring the CEO
