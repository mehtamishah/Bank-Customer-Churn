# Improving Bank Customer Retention Project
Addressing the issue of customer churn in a bank <br>
*Business problem is fictitious and has been designed by me to help you build business acumen

Business Problem: <br>
The CEO of a bank is focusing on customer retention as a part of the business strategy for the next financial year. He has asked you to present a business case for a project to reduce customer attrition by the end of the week.
This is all the data that the bank has : [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)

Business metric: <br>
Customer Turnover rate = 
(Customers lost at the end of a given period / Number of customers at the start) * 100 %

Words of Advice: <br>
Think of what you would do before you scroll down. That's how you will build your data science decision making skills. <br>

A majority of education, even today, tells you what to do instead of teaching you how to choose what to do. <br>

What tools you use or steps you take only make sense when the context is defined. The context can that be of the business problem, of the market, of the stakeholders, of data availability and much, much more. Only when you define the context does any of the decisions that follow make sense. <br>

So let's get to it! <br>

My Process: <br><br>
