# Bank Customer Churn Project
Addressing the issue of customer churn in a bank

Business Problem:
It is always more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current paying customer. The CEO of the bank is focusing on customer retention as a part of the business strategy. He has asked me to look into customer churn and present my findings to senior leadership.

Business metric:
Customer Turnover rate = 
(Customers lost at the end of a given period / Number of customers at the start) * 100 %

Analytics:
